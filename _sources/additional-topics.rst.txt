Additional Topics
=================


.. objectives::

   - Additional topics for CMake workshop.
   - A short summary of what we have learned.



Additional topics
-----------------

In addition to the contents covered in this ``Intro to CMake``, there are additional topics and advanced features of the CMake build system that may be of use on projects as they get larger. This is far from a comprehensive list, and information related to unlisted tasks may be found on official CMake documentation.

These topics include:

- `Creating and running tests with CTest <https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop/hello-ctest/>`_.
- `Automated dependency handling with FetchContent <https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop/fetch-content/>`_.
- `Mixing C++ and Fortran <https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop cxx-fortran/>`_.
- `Mixing Python and compiled languages <https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop/python-bindings/>`_.
- `Detecting your environment <https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop/environment/>`_.



Resources and books
-------------------


There are many free resources online regarding CMake:

- The `CMake official documentation
  <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html>`_.
- The `CMake tutorial <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.30/guide/tutorial/index.html#>`_.
- The `HEP Software Foundation <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/>`_ training course.
- `An Introduction to Modern CMake <https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/README.html#>`_.


You can also consult the following books:

- **Professional CMake: A Practical Guide** by Craig Scott.
- **CMake Cookbook** by Radovan Bast and Roberto Di Remigio. The accompanying repository is on `GitHub <https://github.com/dev-cafe/cmake-cookbook>`_.



Summary of `Intro to CMake`
---------------------------

.. keypoints::

   - CMake is a powerful cross-platform build systems generator.
   - CMake provides a very good reference-style documentation.
   - For larger projects you probably want to write a lightweight scaffold around CMake.
   - Many projects use CMake in other words you are not alone if you look for a solution.
   - `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cmake>`_ and `GitHub repositories <https://github.com/search?q=cmake&type=repositories>`_ are a good resource for solutions.
